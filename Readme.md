# Docker Base Images

Base images for frequently used runtimes in Srijan.

# Security
We believe in DevSecOps and all the base images use [Anchore Engine](https://anchore.com/opensource/)
for deep images inspection and vulnerability scanning. These scans are run using [Github Actions](https://github.com/srijanone/docker-base-images/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Docker+Security+Scan%22).
